# Tampermokey's user scripts to facilitate work

### What's Tampermonkey ?

Tampermonkey was first created in May 2010 by Jan Biniok. It first emerged as a Greasemonkey userscript that was wrapped to support Google Chrome. Eventually the code was re-used and published as a standalone extension for Chrome which had more features than Chrome's native script support. In 2011, Tampermonkey was ported to Android, enabling users to use userscripts on Android's internal browser.By 2019, Tampermonkey had over 10 million users. Tampermonkey is one of 33 extensions on the Chrome Web Store to have at least 10 million users.

**Chrome manifest V3**<br>
In January 2019, Biniok wrote in a Google Groups post that the new Chrome manifest V3 would break the extension. The new manifest would ban remotely accessed code which Tampermonkey is dependent on. The userscripts use code that is created by developers not at Google, and instead is created by third-party developers at places like Userscripts.org and Greasyfork. This code is inserted after the extension is installed, however the manifest requires the code to be present at installation.
